This folder contains the necessary code and data to recreate the results of my part II project.

The .ipynb files 'find_preservation_ratios' and 'intergenic_region_lengths' generate the 2 sets of results included in the report. You should be able to run both files with only the information within this git folder, without needing to edit anything.

The data included in this git folder are the versions of the data used by those .ipynb scripts. The code used to generate these versions of the data are in the 'data_collection' folder. If you run the .ipynb scripts, the files that they produce will be saved to the relevant subdirectory of the 'made_by_script' directory, which is empty in this git repo.
